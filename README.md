# Mindex

In this pandemic situation we need to understand what will be the Burn Rate for the employee working in an company so that company or the individual can take measures to improve their mental  health. Keeping that in mind, we have a ML model which calculates Burn Rate of an employee based on past data we have obtained from a kaggle dataset.

We built a Random Forest Regression Model which has an accuracy of 90%.
